This is a place for me to put tools I create for myself to scratch an
itch in solving cloud-hosting types of problems.

Right now there's only one thing here: a Python module for creating a
serial-console to an AWS instance, using SSH as the transport.  It's a
little rough around the edges; but with any luck, I intend to smooth
those out, as I get the time to do that.

Things will be organized in folders named by cloud-hosting service
providers.
